# Software Engineer Portfolio: Crafting Digital Solutions

Greetings, esteemed colleagues and fellow developers! üåü I am Ubaid Mahmood, a graduate software engineer with a passion for building elegant solutions and unraveling complex problems. Allow me to introduce myself through the lens of programming languages and machine learning:

## üåê Java: Web Servers and Android Development

In the realm of web development and mobile ecosystems, I wield the power of **Java**:

- **Web Servers**:
  - With **Spring Boot**, I forge robust web servers that withstand heavy traffic. I summon endpoints, dance with databases, and weave security layers.

- **Android Mobile Development**:
  - In the code dojo of **Android Studio**, I sculpt UIs, bind data, and orchestrate seamless user experiences.

## ü§ñ Python: Unleashing Machine Learning and Web-Server Forces

Within the sanctum of data science, I invoke the **Python** language to unravel intricate patterns:

- **Scikit-Learn**: My wand for machine learning adventures. Regression, classification, clustering‚ÄîI wield them all.
- Ancient scrolls of data manipulation, **Pandas**, allow me to summon DataFrames, merge datasets, and cleanse noisy data.
- With **TensorFlow and Keras**, I explore the depths of deep learning. Neural networks rise, and gradients flow.
- My cosmic canvas, **Jupyter Notebook**, hosts sketches of models, visualizes insights, and ponders the meaning of loss functions.
- **Web-Server**:
  - With **Flask**, I can integrate ML models with the web-server, enabling responses with predictions and classifications. 

## ‚öõÔ∏è JavaScript and React: Crafting Web Experiences

In the epic saga of web development, I weave intricate patterns using **JavaScript** and **React**:

- **JavaScript**:
  - As the cosmic language of the web, I bend it to my will:
    - **Node.js** opens portals to server-side JavaScript. I brew APIs, handle requests, and synchronize events.
    - **Express.js**, an excellent framework, allows me to route, validate, and serve content to external and internal browsers.

- **React**: My stardust for front-end magic:
  - **Components** I can assemble to be reusable, modular, and responsive.
  - **State and Props** transmits information of an object, updating views and triggering frequent re-renders.
  - **Hooks** empower me to manage state, effects, and prop lifecycles.

## üìä Machine Learning Domains

In the astral plane of ML, I've navigated the following domains:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: These Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures unravel patterns in images, classifying objects from pixels.
- **MoveNet**: Is a CNN architecture for key-point detection. It illuminates poses, tracking human bodies in motion.

## üåü Projects and Quests

- **Model Configs**: This repo contains a 3-stage ML pipeline. The pipeline consists of VGG-16, MoveNet and EfficientB-0 architectures. It is utilised to filter explicit images according to Islamic Prinicples via blocking.
- **Filtering Application**: This is a web-application created for the Model-Configs Repo. The application shows the integration of 3-stage ML pipeline through Flask and React.
- **Islamic Compass**: This is a Android application with a compass as the main feature, the compass showcases the Qibla (Islamic direction of prayer). It is created in Java and contains a Node,js web server, additionally, the data is stored in MongoDB.
